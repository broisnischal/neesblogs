Today, we are going to learn about the database, and covering the beginning to
advanced database concepts and making the roadmap and path what should you
learn.

First, we will start with Fundamental Concepts

- Data Types: Understanding different data types and their usage.
- SQL Basics: CRUD operations, joins, indexing, and normalization.
- ER Diagrams: Designing relational models.

Ok, now let's move on to Intermediate Concepts

- `Advanced SQL` : Window functions, subqueries, CTEs, and performance tuning.
- `Migrations`: Schema changes, version control, tools like Flyway or Liquibase.
- `Transactions`: ACID properties, isolation levels, and concurrency control.
- `Indexes`: Types of indexes, index tuning, and impact on performance.

Advanced Concepts

- <strong>Database Design</strong>: Normalization vs. denormalization, sharding,
  and partitioning.
- <strong>Pooling</strong>: Connection pooling, load balancing, and optimizing
  connections.
- <strong>Backup and Recovery</strong>: Strategies, tools, and automated backup
  processes.
- <strong>Replication</strong>: Master-slave, master-master, and distributed
  databases.

Good, you're caught up on the advanced, now moving on to become an expert

> Database Security: Encryption, access control, and auditing.
>
> Query Optimization: Execution plans, indexing strategies, and optimizing
> complex queries.
>
> NoSQL Databases: Understanding document, key-value, columnar, and graph
> databases.
>
> High Availability: Clustering, failover strategies, and disaster recovery.

Tools and Technologies that you should know, and how to use them ðŸš€

- ORMs: Mastering ORMs like Drizzle, Prisma, TypeORM, and Sequelize.
- Monitoring Tools like pgAdmin, Grafana, Prometheus for performance and health
  monitoring.
- Cloud Databases: AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database, and their
  specific features.

## Real world application

- Microservices: Designing databases for microservices architectures.
- Event Sourcing and CQRS: Advanced patterns for high-performance systems.
- Data Warehousing: Building and maintaining data warehouses, ETL processes.

Learning path :-

1. Master basic SQL and data types.
2. Dive into advanced SQL and transactions.
3. Learn about schema migrations and version control.
4. Study indexing and query optimization.
5. Explore backup, recovery, and replication.
6. Gain expertise in database security and high availability.
7. Experiment with different database technologies and architectures.
8. Implement real-world projects to solidify knowledge.

<br />
This roadmap should give you a structured path to becoming proficient in
database management and development.
